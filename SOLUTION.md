# Solution Steps

1. Define a TypeScript interface 'Post' in types/Post.ts to strongly type blog posts.

2. Create a typed async function 'fetchPosts' in pages/index.tsx that returns a Promise<Post[]> to simulate fetching posts.

3. In the Home page component, define useState hooks for posts (typed as Post[] or null), loading (boolean), and error (string or null).

4. Use useEffect to fetch the posts with the 'fetchPosts' function on initial page mount. Track and cancel any running fetch if the component unmounts.

5. Display a loading indicator ('Loading blog posts...') when the data is being fetched.

6. Show an error message if loading fails.

7. Once fetched, render list of blog posts (titles and content) in a type-safe (never undefined) manner, using the typed Post interface.

8. Add fallback for empty post lists.

9. Follow best practices: type state and functions, no race conditions (use cancellation pattern), proper loading/error handling, and render only when data is ready.
